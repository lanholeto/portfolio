    "text": "I am a passionate and innovative research scientist with expertise in cellular and molecular biology, toxicology, and bioassays, specializing in the study of arthropods of medical and veterinary importance—particularly ticks. With a PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology and extensive experience in nanoformulation, microscopy, and analytical method development, I thrive on transforming complex biological problems into practical solutions with real-world applications. My work is driven by the need for sustainable, environmentally friendly strategies to control ticks and other arthropods of medical and veterinary significance. Using histology, histochemistry, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and electron microscopy, I study the effects of synthetic and natural products on tick internal organs. By integrating molecular and toxicological approaches, I aim to bridge the gap between fundamental research and applied solutions, developing safer, more effective pest management strategies.\nIf you’d like to get in touch, I’d love to hear from you!
