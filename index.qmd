<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a passionate and innovative research scientist with expertise in **cellular and molecular biology**, toxicology, and bioassays, specializing in the study of arthropods of medical and veterinary importance—particularly **ticks**. With a PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology and extensive experience in nanoformulation, microscopy, and analytical method development, I thrive on transforming complex biological problems into practical solutions with real-world applications. My work is driven by the need for **sustainable, environmentally friendly strategies to control ticks** and other arthropods of medical and veterinary significance. Using histology, histochemistry, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and electron microscopy, I study the effects of synthetic and natural products on tick internal organs. By integrating molecular and toxicological approaches, I aim to bridge the gap between fundamental research and applied solutions, developing safer, more effective pest management strategies.
