The present study analyzed the effects of different concentrations of
*Acmella oleracea* crude ethanolic extract (EEAO) on the development of
germ cells from semi-engorged *Amblyomma cajennense* females in order to
evaluate the potential of this natural chemical as a strategy to control
these important ectoparasites. A hundred semi-engorged females were
divided into five groups (duplicates) (10 animals/group): Control 1
(distilled water); Control 2 (solvent ethanol 50% and DMSO 1%); and
Treatment I to III (3.1, 6.2, and 12.5 mg/mL of EEAO, respectively). For
the exposure of the ticks to the extract was used the Adult Immersion
Test. After the exposition, the ovaries were removed and submitted to
histological analysis using Harris hematoxylin and aqueous eosin. The
histochemical tests were performed using PAS and Bromophenol blue
staining techniques, for the detection of total polysaccharides and
total protein, respectively. The extract caused significant alterations
in the oocytes, including changes in the shape of the cells,
disorganization, and cytoplasmic vacuolation, decrease in the number of
yolk granules and germ vesicle fragmentation. These alterations were
more intense in the oocytes in initial developmental stages (I and II).
The results obtained in this study confirm the cytotoxic potential of
the ethanolic extract of *A. oleracea* on the germ cells of *A.
cajennense* females, opening up the possibility to use this extract as
an alternative to control these ectoparasites.
